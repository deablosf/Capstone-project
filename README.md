# Capstone-project
Once more unto the Breach! 
# Build A Rig
## -Mission Statement-
Helps you figure out what you’ll need and how much it’ll cost when building your own computer. All while avoiding noob mistakes like component incompatibility, under powered power supplies and case size mismeasurement. This is aimed more towards beginnners but expert rig builders can use this with no problem.

## -MVP-
Computer components - cases, motherboards, CPUs, Ram, Graphics cards and Hard drives. Three - five items each and a compatible tab. Add these things to a list and have the compatibility checked and the cost added.

## -Java models-
### cases 
### motherboards 
### CPUs 
### Ram 
### Graphics cards 
### Hard drives.

## -WireFrame-
The hell if I know what shape this madness will take.

## -Post MVP-
Login \
Shopping cart\
Instant notice if something isn’t compatible 

## -Project Schedule-

Then Java\
After that I crap myself in react!

## -Day unknown-
It took a full 4 days to get the database and Java talking to each other. I still don't know what happened.

## -Day Weekend-
Had to go to work, couldn't work on project. But I did think of a way to present the components.

## -Day: Sept 07-
Nothing but the last thing on my schedule has worked out as I thought. I'm just writing code hoping to hit the minimum to pass. I realy wish the react mod didn't crash and burn.
