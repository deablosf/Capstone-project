# Capstone-project
Once more unto the Breach! 
# Build A Rig
## -Mission Statement-
Helps you figure out what you’ll need and how much it’ll cost when building your own computer. All while avoiding noob mistakes like component incompatibility, under powered power supplies and case size mismeasurement. 

## -MVP-
Computer components - cases, motherboards, CPUs, Ram, Graphics cards and Hard drives. Three - five items each and a compatible tab. Add these things to a list and have the compatibility checked and the cost added.

## -Java models-
### cases 
### motherboards 
### CPUs 
### Ram 
### Graphics cards 
### Hard drives.

## -WireFrame-
The hell if I know what shape this madness will take.

## -Post MVP-

Instant notice if something isn’t compatible 

## -Project Schedule-
First thing the DataBase\
Then Java\
After that I crap myself in react!
